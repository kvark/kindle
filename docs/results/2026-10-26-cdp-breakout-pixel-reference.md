# A simple pixel follower also fails Breakout

A fixed CPU controller scores **11.333 across24 natural episodes**, with0/24
two-wall successes. It constructs no Kindle agent, performs no GPU work or
learning, and supplies no training guidance. Its complete recorded-action replay
matches every reward, boundary, frame count and task outcome.

The rule uses native max-pooled RGB frames: a red-color mask estimates the ball
centroid in rows90–184 and the paddle centroid in rows185–197, columns8–151.
It chooses RIGHT/LEFT when horizontal error exceeds two pixels, otherwise NOOP,
and FIRE when either object is unavailable. This is hand-written game-specific
control with access to native image detail, not a learned visual representation.
No RAM is read. The fixed rule was checked against existing random-trajectory
images before one evaluation; no controller sweep or selected checkpoint follows.

Protocol matches the compact Breakout evaluation: eight independent lanes,
seed4000001009 and recorded per-lane seeds, full18 actions, sticky.25, repeat4,
zero no-op starts and100000-frame episode limit. The budget is the first three
natural episodes per lane, capped at600k aggregate actions and180 CPU seconds.

Collection completes in **6.062s**, using13,936 actions/55,694 emulator frames.
It collects27 natural episodes, selects the first24 as declared, and retains
three excess episodes and partial tails. There are zero truncations. Independent
full replay takes6.994s and retains a complete stream0 video.

This weak rule is not a useful teacher candidate on present evidence. Its score
does not isolate a control, detector or timing failure, and it does not establish
an encoder limitation. The retained learned policy's current-host score67.583
is stronger, although its training budget and model differ. Keep the reference
separate from native learning results and retain the original two-wall gate.
