# Intermediate Pong: modest gain, no match wins

The fixed200k-action screen improves the frozen score but fails the Pong gate.
Fresh seed1009, centered CDP/action-effects1, Size4M/RGB48/Auto,

Native max-pooled frames receive one GPU resize; no action aid. Actual trainable

Training completes200000 aggregate actions,799850 emulator frames and24970
updates in621.700s (10m22s),321.70 actions/s, first update at248 and zero debt.
There are123 completed training matches; last50 mean−17.56. The selected frozen
gain is3.25 points, with no wins. It does not meet the mean≥15/90%-wins gate.

Final frozen collection uses68880 actions/275483 emulator frames in25.69s and
collects25 natural matches. Selection remains the first three per lane; the one
excess match and all tails remain in the full replay/video. Actual initial uses
24200 actions/96771 frames in9.05s and collects24 matches. Both have zero updates,
no truncations and exact equality of all346 frozen tensors.

All24970 reports, counters/config/source checks, finite checkpoints, full CPU
action replays/videos and host guards pass. Service

This is one reused development seed with changed capacity, resolution, replay
ratio and runtime relative to historical controls. A small frozen gain is useful
evidence, not reliable winning or a matched-resolution ablation. No Pong extension
is queued. The next allocation is the separately declared fresh Boxing2017
test with500k actions/R32, retaining the30-minute training cap.
