# Vectorized LeVJEPA collection and GPU throughput

Started 2026-09-06 after an explicit request to prioritize vectorized environments
and batched inference, even at the cost of a day of setup. This is one shared
policy/learner, not swarm learning or asynchronous actor/learner services.

## Baseline and decision

The original Atari runner used one environment and one-frame live inference.
Only replay training was batched (B16×T64). Its last inspected 30-minute GPU
trace averaged 58.64% activity, 8,217 MiB and 117.90 W on the RTX 5080. Activity
is a sampled busy fraction, not achieved FLOPs or occupancy; power below the
360 W limit alone does not prove inefficiency. Wall-time stages do establish a
large learner bottleneck: about 0.54 s/update and 5.5 executed actions/s.

The serial mastery queue was stopped with SIGINT at 21:01 UTC. Its last logged
learner record is action 64,390 / update 15,827; its verified 60k checkpoint and
logs are preserved. Unlogged in-flight work is not an audited endpoint. The
single-stream LeVJEPA mastery gate remains unachieved; details are in the
[original experiment](2026-09-06-levjepa-pong.md).

## Implemented collection contract

- One frozen LeVJEPA weight set. Dense layers process all stream rows together;
  attention currently dispatches independent stream blocks in the same session.
  Each stream has its own 16-arrival KV history and position. Missing arrivals
  do not advance it. A real reset affects only that stream; chunk boundaries
  still do not reset the RSSM.
- Batched live RSSM posterior and policy sessions. Each stream keeps its own
  belief, pending action and policy/posterior RNG. Stream seeds are model seed
  plus stream index (wrapping u64); environment seeds are separately recorded.
- One learner, optimizer, return normalizer and shared-capacity replay. Replay
  retains per-stream order, evicts globally by arrival age, drains fresh starts
  before uniformly sampling eligible starts across streams, and refreshes the
  correct stream's cached posterior context.
- Every executed action advances the global counter and, once warm, adds
  R/(B×T) credit. Initial/episode-reset frames do neither. Warmup counts eligible
  sequence starts across streams. The first eligible vector round gives one
  update; later rounds drain all due updates, without silently discarding debt.
- Python steps the independent ALE instances synchronously, submits their
  observations together, consumes terminal frames before resetting affected
  streams, and logs all actions/rewards/boundaries. CPU environment time is
  below 1% of measured wall time; subprocess environments are not needed yet.
- Checkpoints additionally record `collection_streams`. Model state can be
  restored into a fresh vector collector or a single-stream frozen evaluator;
  replay, exact RNGs, environments, live beliefs and visual caches are not saved.

Maintained entry points: `VectorDreamerAgent`, `kindle.VectorAgent`,
`python/examples/atari_vector.py`, `python/examples/profile_atari_vector.py`,
and the CPU-only `kindle._vector_audit` ledger checker. The original `Agent` and
Atari runner remain the serial/DINO control. The new vector frontend is LeVJEPA.

## Correctness before throughput

Initial native checks on the selected RTX 5080:

- Batched LeVJEPA matches serial dense and pooled features **bit-for-bit** over
  36 vector rounds with reversed input order, unequal reset times, missing
  arrivals and chunk boundaries. The existing pinned PyTorch Pong reference
  also passes (worst dense absolute error 0.00026131, relative L2 <1e-4).
- Three batched live beliefs and sampled policies match independent serial
  streams under different terminal/timeout/reset schedules.
- The N=1 vector learner matches serial scheduled losses and final world
  parameters exactly, including reset handling and checkpoint restore. The
  initial full-size N=1 benchmark's learner metrics also match the interrupted
  serial seed-0 prefix (world/behavior metrics, not wall-time fields).
- Replay tests cover uneven streams, global eviction and context refresh;
  scheduler tests count actions, not vector ticks or reset records. Python
  audits reject missing updates, wrong resets/rewards, and null/nonfinite losses.

## First matrix: same learner, batched collection

`runs/vector-20260906-first/`: N=1,2,4 executed serially, seed 0, 3,072 aggregate
actions each. Published Atari wrapper, full 12M recipe, B16×T64, full BPTT64,
row microbatch16, R256, learning rate4e-5, warmup1000, AGC0.3, reconstruction0,
future prediction0.25, extrinsic-only own sampled actions. All start fresh.
Timing uses the final 1,024 actions, after warmup: exactly 256 updates in each
window. Construction and prefill are excluded from that window and reported
separately. Brief CPU builds/checks also ran during parts of the exploratory
matrix; small differences need a quiet repeat, not an overprecise speed claim.

| Environments | Aggregate actions/s | Mean update, s | GPU activity | Mean W | Window peak MiB |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 5.395 | 0.54395 | 58.38% | 117.43 | 8,249 |
| 2 | 5.853 | 0.54632 | 53.45% | 120.87 | 9,145 |
| 4 | 6.029 | 0.53499 | 55.81% | 123.30 | 10,708 |

Cold construction is 91.02 / 92.38 / 91.87 s. Full runs have 497 / 481 / 450
updates because each additional stream needs its own sequence context during
warmup. All three full accounting audits pass. The N=4 prefix completes no
games; this matrix is not a gameplay result or an amended mastery endpoint.

Native SHA-256:
`e99944abd4953bcf3ab6e41cd95c9e6bc95a12fbc49eef2e6bd9488f1b34c4d9`.
Runner SHA-256:
`340ed16d8a2d03653cf1afe47d5ef0d1abd7c0c0238834431df01a610bd61a1b`.
Meganeura remains `35a410ce1262c396e137db5bfab1d58e35cee50a`, Blade
`b208f3b1f97196c2971436b5726e61e71b149c37`. The native executable is archived
beside the matrix. Each run records the pinned encoder identity and wrapper hash.

Vectorization alone yields about 12% more aggregate actions/s. At N=2 the
1,024-action window spends 141.13 s in learning, 33.15 s in observation handling,
0.47 s stepping environments and 0.13 s selecting actions. The learner remains
about 81% of wall time. Aggregate speed must not be called per-stream speed:
at N=4, 6.03 total actions/s is roughly 1.51 actions/s per environment.

## Same-math learner cleanup

`runs/vector-20260906-cpu/` repeats N=2, B16 and the same 3,072-action protocol
after caching softmax exponentials, reusing categorical/decoder scratch and
submitting independent imagination heads before one combined readback/wait.
All **481 world and behavior reports match the original N=2 run bit-for-bit**;
the complete interaction/credit audit passes. Timing fields are excluded from
the numerical comparison.

The final 1,024 actions / 256 updates take 165.16 s: **6.200 actions/s**, mean
update 0.51189 s, GPU activity 58.58%, mean power 125.34 W and peak 9,145 MiB.
That is about 6% faster than the initial N=2 path, not a solution to the remaining
GPU bubbles. Cold construction takes 91.38 s. Native SHA-256 is
`8184d4db5a47c2ddd7ad9956a17ddf2463311834af70b8023d4a46d53fc7f761`;
the runner and dependency pins are unchanged. This executable is also archived.

The numerical/model GPU tests pass. In one combined-process run, the last two
readback tests failed while creating their GPU contexts (`NoSupportedDeviceFound`);
both passed in a fresh process. The cause is not diagnosed, so this is not an
unqualified clean full-suite result. Long training uses one shared context.

### Bounded CPU row parallelism

`runs/vector-20260906-parallel/` adds one local pool of at most eight CPU workers
for large independent categorical and scalar-decoder rows. Uniform draws are
generated in the original serial RNG order; each row retains its arithmetic
order. Small/live batches stay serial. This is not actor/learner separation.

All 481 world/behavior reports and every transition, episode and reset agree
exactly with the preceding N=2 run. The accounting audit passes. The final
1,024-action / 256-update window takes **157.54 s, 6.500 actions/s**, with a
0.47898 s mean update, 61.18% GPU activity, 129.87 W and 9,145 MiB peak VRAM.
Cold construction takes 91.60 s. This is about 20% faster than the initial N=1
path; at N=2 it is 3.25 actions/s per environment, still below real-time learning.

Native SHA-256:
`9d6290a3c4b39f826771e1020976d2be81a5b9e6e3a1a80577ee5a285efac38b`.
Runner SHA-256 (now records CPU worker count):
`ee636253c5c90eb8c7902752660c14ee7b077e025e27a17c982b71e97be9c373`.
The executable and runner are archived; dependency pins and scientific recipe
are unchanged.

## Larger replay batch: separate optimizer-cadence experiment

`runs/vector-20260906-b32/` keeps N=2, T64/full BPTT, R256 and the same learning
rate recipe, but doubles B and its row microbatch to 32. It runs 4,096 aggregate
actions so the measured final 1,024 actions are all after the larger warmup.
The window contains exactly **128 updates**, not 256: equal total replay samples
do not imply equal optimizer trajectories, warmup in interactions or learning
quality. This is not a numerics-preserving systems comparison.

The window takes 126.10 s: **8.121 actions/s**, 0.69326 s/update, GPU activity
53.82%, 135.17 W and 10,416 MiB peak. Cold construction is 93.93 s. The full
accounting audit passes. Native/runner hashes match the CPU-parallel B16 run.
The lower busy fraction despite higher useful throughput is another reason not
to optimize the utilization percentage alone. Keep B16 as the learning control
until a predeclared quality comparison validates a larger batch.

`runs/vector-20260906-b64/` tests B64/full row64 at N=2 and N=4, with 6,144
aggregate actions planned per job. N=2 completes and passes the accounting
audit (121 updates over the full run). Its final 1,024 actions / 64 updates
take **129.50 s, 7.907 actions/s**, mean update 1.45014 s, GPU activity 54.95%,
126.66 W and 12,999 MiB peak. This does not beat B32. Synchronization grows to
roughly 0.12 s world / 0.09 s behavior per update; that observation is not yet a
diagnosis of the cause.

N=4/B64 is **rejected during construction**, before a run header or any training,
by Meganeura's memory-budget guard: 14.91 GB already allocated, another 0.07 GB
requested, and 10% of the 16.57 GB reported device budget reserved for the driver
and pipelines. Do not disable that reserve or report this job as a timing result.
The raw failure is retained in `n4.log`; the original matrix command exits
nonzero and has no complete matrix summary. The profiler now retains explicit
failed-job summaries before returning a nonzero exit status.

B64 native SHA-256 (metadata-getter/API cleanup only since the B32 build):
`86fe65da46c99698a20f471e925b712f0e0689ced6a462085ce0d0b902484c73`.
Runner SHA-256 (rejects zero row-microbatch arguments):
`54ed3e3d91fa098d2257370fdf170d7a2fd26eb407d53a15ee8b63a6a4e11ee6`.

## Compensated tensor-core candidate: not adopted

The production pin remains Meganeura `35a410c`; production LeVJEPA remains F32.
An isolated backend candidate at `bc3a1e41303c046a1126c56cc9048d02eeade6b0`
adds an explicit, opt-in `CompensatedF16` policy. It splits bounded inference
operands into high and scaled-low components, uses three f16-input/f32-accumulator
matrix products, and leaves the sensitive-gradient F32 guard and default `Auto`
policy intact. This is not full-f32 exponent range and not permission to use
raw f16 gradients.

The first cast-roundtrip split produced **exactly the raw f16 result**, with
no residual correction; scaling that residual did not help. Explicit f32
mantissa masking makes the correction effective. Normal/transposed matrix
products and fused tanh epilogues then pass: worst tested plain-matrix absolute
error drops from 0.00155342 to 0.00000715. Both hardware tests and all 218 backend
CPU tests pass, including the tiny-gradient guard. No system profiling/security
settings were changed when `perf` access was denied.

Kindle's isolated experiment is preserved at `70a7ce76bd2be8d27e3b671acdaec84ca735bce1`
on `exp/levjepa-compensated`, not integrated into the production branch. It uses
an explicitly different encoding identity and actual dependency pins. The full
37-observation pinned Pong reference passes, including automatic chunk boundaries,
explicit resets and projected/pooled features: worst dense absolute error
0.00038910 and relative L2 0.00001054 (gates 0.005 and 0.0001).

A matched two-stream diagnostic processes 64 synthetic 160×210 RGB frames per
stream, with unequal resets, excluding the first chunk from timing. Both paths
use the same unoptimized Rust test build and GPU; dense diagnostic readback is
outside the timed encoding call. F32 averages **96.459 ms/vector call** and the
candidate **95.689 ms**, with 97 genuinely compensated dispatches. Maximum dense
disagreement is 0.00019646, relative L2 0.00000562. The <1% mean improvement does
not demonstrate a material frontend win and is not a production throughput claim.
Do not change the production encoding or rerun a long learning suite for this
candidate; keep the smaller, measured F32 control. A different kernel would need
a new latency/accuracy comparison.

## Pixel checkpoint/restore canary

`runs/vector-20260906-canary/` starts a fresh seed-99, N=2/B16 agent with the
production F32 frontend. It completes 2,000 aggregate own-action transitions,
213 scheduled updates and two natural games (both −21). Its 166.46 s execution
time includes replay prefill, so **12.02 aggregate actions/s is not a steady
learning speed claim**. The complete accounting and real-frame clocks pass.

`checkpoints/levjepa-vector-canary-20260906` records format 3, the exact encoder
hash, `collection_streams: 2`, action 2,000 and update 213. Restoring this shared
model into N=1 frozen sampled evaluation completes 1,000 further actions with
exactly zero updates; its one completed game scores −19, not mastery. The frozen
run is bound to the final vector save by equal metadata/tensor fingerprints,
and its full audit passes. It takes 48.43 s excluding construction (20.65
actions/s, 1.376× the game clock), which establishes frozen play only. Replay,
live belief, visual history and RNG continuation remain fresh on restore.

These are integration checks, not a continuation or replacement endpoint for
the interrupted single-stream LeVJEPA mastery experiment. No long learning
queue was restarted by these canaries.

## Next measured changes

Current CPU checks: 75 Kindle and five gym tests pass, with 15 hardware tests
explicitly skipped by the ordinary command; 136 Python tests pass. Rust/Python
Clippy and formatting checks pass. The vector auditor also verifies reported
aggregate/per-stream game clocks and rejects invalid throughput accounting.
Later API-only cleanup exposes learner metadata directly instead of returning
an unused single-stream diagnostic core; the measured binaries remain archived.

1. Keep B16 as the learning control. B32 has a throughput benefit but needs a
   predeclared learning-quality comparison at matched aggregate interactions,
   with its changed optimizer cadence and warmup reported. B64 is not the next
   default: it did not beat B32 at N=2 and failed the memory guard at N=4.
2. Focus subsequent systems work on batched non-recurrent learner heads, grouped
   RSSM/layout work and host/GPU transfers. The tested compensated frontend did
   not demonstrate a material speedup. Never re-enable reduced-exponent-range
   kernels for sensitive learner gradients.
3. Only after throughput and accounting checks, predeclare fresh vectorized
   Pong training seeds, aggregate interaction budgets and final frozen gates.
   Preserve failed/interrupted runs and do not select winning checkpoints.
