# Kindle working direction

Kindle learns while acting. Games are the first testbed; sparse explicit rewards
and human guidance are allowed. Favor minimalism, expressiveness, safety and
speed. Keep learning/inference native on Meganeura + Blade. Python is for game
adapters, reference controls and analysis. Follow `/mnt/data/GUIDELINES.md` when
available. Only the user merges PRs; commits and pushes are allowed.

## Start here

- [Machine handover](docs/handover.md): source branches, build instructions,
  shared checkpoint/evidence package and the exact unfinished experiment.
- [Roadmap](docs/kindle_single_life_dreamer_plan.md): current results and priorities.
- [PR31](https://github.com/kvark/kindle/pull/31): live status dashboard. Update its
  description when status changes; do not create a separate STATUS.md.
- [GPU incident](docs/results/2026-10-23-cdp-context64-gpu-fault.md): evidence and
  limits of the repeated initialization failures on the original machine.

## Active direction

Training is the priority. Backend optimization, upstream porting and JAX parity
are parked. The selected architecture is **centered CDP**, with a jointly learned
CNN, categorical RSSM and imagined actor/critic. No pretrained DINO or Tiny JEPA
encoder is required. Explicitly select CDP; the CLI default remains learned RGB.
Work on `phase2-levjepa-evaluation` and PR31. This branch now includes the
qualified c8aeba28 implementation with portable dependencies. Do not switch to
a separate takeover branch. Keep `runs/`, large data and archived experiment
ledgers out of Git; old evidence lives on the explicitly named archive branch.

The five-game goal is unfinished. Boxing and Pong win consistently; aided
Freeway crosses consistently; Breakout and Qbert remain much weaker. Published
long-run scores are aspirations, not matched-budget comparisons. Do not claim
mastery or CDP superiority from short runs, finite losses or backend speed alone.

Current learning test: Breakout B2/T64 versus retained B8/T16, keeping128 replay
positions/update and replay ratio32. Longer sequences also reduce independent
sequences; disclose that confound. The original4096-action smoke completed867
updates, but ordinary frozen restore failed on the original GPU. On this AMD
host, bounded restore and a new F16-input smoke pass; the fresh2M life is running.
See `docs/results/2026-10-25-cdp-amd-takeover.md` for its service and evidence.
Do not launch a duplicate learner. BF16 and `KINDLE_DEVICE_TARGETS` are unavailable
on this current path; preserve the explicit precision/execution-path confound.
Do not restart completed training, old queues, broad seed campaigns or unchanged
long extensions. Keep single-actor learning ahead of swarms/concurrent learners.

## Experiment practice

- Use small development runs and meaningful checks; avoid turning preparation
  into another backend qualification project. Automate monitoring and audits.
- Keep batched inference with eight independent Atari environments. Report
  aggregate actions and emulator frames separately, plus wall-clock time.
- Retain explicit config, seeds, native/source identity, learning curves and
  frozen natural-episode evaluation against actual-initial controls. Record
  exploration aids, budgets, cutoffs and failed attempts. Confirm promising
  changes across seeds; selected/reused development seeds are not held-out tests.
- Checkpoints do not preserve replay, live belief, games or RNG. A restored
  extension is a warm start, not uninterrupted learning or an independent seed.
- Preserve visual detail: native max-pooled frames with one GPU resize. Do not
  reintroduce CPU downscale followed by upscale.
- Put compact results in docs/results and update PR31. Logs, weights, videos,
  build caches and profiling dumps belong outside Git. Keep only useful
  checkpoint milestones; release disposable build caches after packaging.

## GPU operation

GPU work is authorized unless the device is genuinely faulted. Known allocation
warnings alone are not an approval gate. Use the existing host guard and stop on
real faults or numerical failures. No automatic driver reset/reload/reboot.
Separate NVML polling is unnecessary for the current experiment.

Historical boot24f26399 on595.91.07 remained faulted. A later boot9461079a
was observed during handover; no GPU health check was performed by this task.
Repeated PMU halts occurred on595 and615; the latest captured wait was in the
first world's device-local initialization fills, before checkpoint loading.
This is localization, not proof of a buffer bug, firmware cause or bad hardware.
A debugger run with ASLR disabled once succeeded; that is not a fix.

On that host, use the prepared pre-submission capture after recovery, not another
blind restore. On a different healthy GPU, do not inherit the old boot/device
assertions or presume it is wedged. Start with bounded initialization/restore,
record the new device/driver, and stop if the fault reproduces. The ABI-specific
GDB collector is for the original binary only, not an arbitrary rebuild.

## Historical material

Original run/checkpoint archives were relocated to
`/x/Artifacts/shared-drive-cleanup-20261025` on the original machine. The4096-action
context smoke and2M Breakout originals are present and match all346 tensors in
the shared handover exports; see the handover for exact paths and counters.

The old incident/optimization ledgers and detailed experiment data remain on
`archive/phase2-before-cleanup-20261025`. Current result reports are retained here. Historical “next” paragraphs are not active instructions.
User-authored TASK.md and docs/cdp-claude-feedback.md are preserved as context;
subsequent CDP decisions and current measured results supersede their older
architecture/performance assumptions. Do not merge upstream PRs on the user's
behalf or modify neighboring worktrees during handover.
